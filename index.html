        Various lists of the Wonders of the World have been compiled from antiquity to the present day, in order to
        catalogue the world's most spectacular natural features and human-built structures.

        The Seven Wonders of the Ancient World is the oldest known list of this type, documenting the most iconic and
        remarkable human-made creations of classical antiquity; it was based on guidebooks popular among Hellenic
        sightseers and as such only includes works located around the Mediterranean rim and in the ancient Near East.
        The number seven was chosen because the Greeks believed it represented perfection and plenty, and because it
        reflected the number of planets known in ancient times (five) plus the Sun and Moon.[1]</p>

                    <details>
                        Great Wall of China
                        The Great Wall of China was built during the Qin dynasty to protect the borders of the ancient
                        Chinese states in imperial China against invasion by foreigners. It also had an economic
                        benefit, as
                        it provided border controls and allowed the imposition of duties on goods transported along the
                        Silk
                        Road. This longest wall in the world is a collection of several walls built during the 7th
                        century
                        BC which were later joined together. The most famous among these walls is the one built by Qin
                        Shi
                        Huang during 220–206 BC. The fortifications are made up of stone, brick, wood, and many other
                        materials.

                        Petra
                        The city of Petra is an archaeological site in Jordan that lies on the slope of Mount Jebel
                        al-Madhbah. In 1984, UNESCO described it as “half built and half carved into the rock at the
                        interior of a circle of mountains…is obviously one of the most precious cultural properties [of]
                        man’s cultural heritage”. Petra, also known as the “Rose City”, was built by the Nabataeans who
                        inhabited in the city for more than a thousand years. They used the city’s location to lay the
                        foundation of a trading hub. The place is not only famous for its rock architecture of vibrant
                        vermilion, moon white and pink colors, but also for its innovative water conduit system. Fun
                        fact –
                        Petra was used as the setting where Indiana Jones finds the Holy Grail in the 1989 blockbuster
                        Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.

                        Christ the Redeemer is an art deco statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This
                        structure
                        was created by the combined efforts of French sculptor Paul Landowski, Brazilian engineer Heitor
                        da
                        Silva Costa, Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida and French engineer Albert Caquot. Situated at
                        the
                        apex of Mount Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro, this awe-inspiring statue weighs 635 metric tons and
                        is
                        30-meter tall. It’s made of concrete and a mosaic of many triangular soapstones.

                    <details>
                        Located in the Cusco Region, Machupicchu district in Peru, these ancient Incan ruins have been a
                        favorite destination among tourists. These ruins include palaces, temples and homes which may
                        have been constructed for a ceremonial or military purpose, or as a retreat for the royals. They
                        are surrounded by the stormy and chaotic Urubamba River flowing in the Sacred Valley. Due to the
                        lack of records of written language, we don’t have any information about why the Incas built
                        this heritage site or abandoned it. In 1911, American historian Hiram Bingham introduced this
                        isolated place and brought it to international attention. Presently, most of the buildings in
                        Machu Picchu have been reconstructed.

                        The Chichen Itza is the most visited heritage site in Mexico. It was once a large pre-Columbian
                        city made by the Mayan people. This site reveals the mixture of the architectural styles of
                        Mexico, Puuc and Chenes. This pyramid, also known as the Temple of the Warriors, structure
                        comprises of a number of square terraces and staircases on each of the four sides of the temple.
                        It is a fine sight during the spring and autumn equinoxes. The sun creates a series of
                        triangular shadows, creating an illusion of a serpent crawling down the stairs.

                        This partially ruined amphitheater in Rome,  the Colosseum, is the largest amphitheatre ever
                        built. Its original Latin name was Amphitheatrum Flavium. In AD 72, the Roman emperor Vespasian
                        laid the foundation of this monument. This structure had the capacity to hold approximately
                        50,000–80,000 spectators. The place was mostly used for gladiator contests, executions, animal
                        hunts and re-enactments of famous battles and dramas. Despite being ruined by natural and
                        man-made catastrophes, it still pulls a large number of tourists.
